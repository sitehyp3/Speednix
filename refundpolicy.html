        <h2>General Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Speed Nix strives to ensure the satisfaction of our customers. However, as a distributor of third-party services, our refund policies are aligned with the policies of the service providers we represent. Refunds may be issued under the following circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Cancellation Before Installation:</strong> If you cancel your service request before the service installation, you may be eligible for a full refund of any upfront payments made to Speed Nix.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Service Issues:</strong> If there is a verifiable issue with the service installation or activation that is directly attributable to Speed Nix, we will work to rectify the issue or, in rare cases, process a refund.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Non-Refundable Items:</strong> Fees associated with the processing of services, including installation charges, activation fees, and administrative costs, are non-refundable.
            </li>
        </ul>
